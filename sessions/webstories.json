  "summary": "Feedback and brainstorming for (re)introducing the Web Consortium to the public. The W3C Comm team wants to get background stories from our Members and community about how they were drawn to the Web (before the Web, or their first involvement with the Web). There is a path for how everyone in our community has come to the Web, what they see happening now and what they see in the future.",
  "type": "open discussion",
  "goals": "We want to gather stories in order to tell a compelling story to the public. W3C Comm team may use this as part of an upcoming crowdfunding campaign.",
  "capacity": "medium",
  "track": "org",
  "report": "<p>We heard from the 16 participants how they were drawn to the Web, their hopes and fears for the future, what get us going, etc. Among ourselves were a few people who were born after the Web. We all come from all walks of life and not one of us had a similar journey leading us to the Web. But every single one of us was amazed by the Web and continues to be in awe of its potential. A majority of us expressed how they hold “making the Web a safer place for people” very dearly.</p><p>The W3C Communications team will get in touch with the participants as we may wish to use their stories, anonymously or not, to tell a compelling story to the public, possibly even as part of an upcoming crowdfunding campaign.</p>"
