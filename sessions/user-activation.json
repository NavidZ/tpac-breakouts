  "report": "<p>We talked about the current (broken) state of the Web and how Chromium recently changed its user activation model to address related problems.  Then we addressed three specific comments our pull request received in the past: scope of the change, testability, and defining activation triggering events.  By the end of the session, everyone was aligned with the proposal although there were some concerns about compatibility in edge cases. Chromium's rollout helps assuage some fears but not all.  We decided to proceed with caution, and also laid out a longer term plan.
