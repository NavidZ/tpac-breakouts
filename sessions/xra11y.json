  "report": "<p>An overview of WAIs current work in the XR space was given, such as in the Research Questions Task force and the APA, including introducing the draft <a href='https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/wiki/Xaur_draft'>XAUR User Requirements</a> document. We discussed some the current accessibility challenges such as a lack of declarative semantics for accessible XR content, as well as issues with rendering environments and performance.</p><p>The Accessibility Object Model (AOM) was discussed, there was a sense that there are limitations with the current AOM, including a lack of implementation of the virtual DOM tree. Other options such as using having native support for glTF in the browser that can give 3D content a DOM for current accessibility APIs to function in XR space were mentioned, as well as how sensor enabled technology may contribute to accessible XR experiences. The need to better understand keyboard and switch requirements was also raised, as well as use of haptics. </p>"
