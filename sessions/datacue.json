  "summary": "The DataCue API for media-synchronised metadata and interactivity events is part of HTML5, but not implemented across all browsers, and existing implementations vary. There are also issues with the time marches on algorithm in HTML for triggering timed interactivity events",
  "type": "talk and open discussion",
  "goals": "To advance the DataCue API design between media experts and browser developers, and discuss how to improve synchronisation of media and associated content on the web",
  "capacity": "medium",
  "track": "media",
  "report": "<p>The group discussed how to expose timed events and timed metadata within media streams, e.g., ID3 tags or emsg events in CMAF. The discussion focused on whether the API should simply expose an ArrayBuffer, per the HTML5 specification, or expose structured data according to the scheme of the event. Next step is to continue the discussion in a session in the Media Working Group TPAC meeting.</p><P>The group also discussed the accuracy of firing of TextTrackCue events during media playback, when seeking, and when adjusting the timing of cues. The HTML spec does not specify a timing accuracy, and implementations vary. The conclusion was to report issues to improve particular implementations, and also add a note to the HTML specification on accuracy.</p><p><a href='https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1p_2wdeGpZ0-gcUv6ogZesZoOueNhj2UofhkCq6e0mfQ/edit'>slides</a></p>"
