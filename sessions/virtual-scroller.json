  "summary": "Describe our work on using <a href='https://github.com/WICG/display-locking'>display locking</a> to prototype the <a href='https://github.com/WICG/virtual-scroller'>virtual-scroller custom element</a> that allows large amounts of content to be present in the DOM without causing performance problems. This is an alternative to virtualization which often breaks accessibility, indexability and in-page find.",

  "goals": "Raise awareness and start discussion about this problem and solution. Demonstrate a use-case for display locking.",
