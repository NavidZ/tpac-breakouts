  "summary": "DIDs are disruptive new technology possessing the possibility to overturn the status quo of data exchange across all industry verticals. But how do we explain this to policy makers, budget decision makers, and customers? Let's discuss how to bring this tech into the non-tech narrative.",
  "type": "open discussion",
  "goals": "The primary goal is to have a non-technical discussion about DIDs and prepare W3C members with the messaging they need to make the case publicly for this new type of identifier.",
  "others": ["kenebert", "DrummondReed"],
  "capacity": "medium",
  "report": "The “Non-technical Discussion” on Decentralized identifiers and Self-Sovereign Identity breakout session resulted in a greater understanding in the need to identify the participants in baseline conversations about DIDs, examples of successful examples and metaphors, and a collection of tips to help guide initial conversations outside of the DID community. Verifiable Credentials were identified as a key part of the explanation that leads to DIDs and help describe the technology to individuals with a variety of technology backgrounds and fluency. The value and benefits of DIDs should be augmented depending on messaging needs in particular communication instances."
