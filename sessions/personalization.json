  "summary": "People have very different needs. some people can not do numeric information, but others prefer numbers to words, some people with severe language disabilities use of symbols to represent words, but one of the main challenges is transforming content for these different needs. We are working on an extreme personalization standard that let people with cognitive and learning disabilities join the online community and share information and communicate across groups. Are there more use-cases and new user groups for this technology? Here are our <a href='https://github.com/w3c/personalization-semantics/wiki/Use-cases'>Use Case Examples</a>. Here is a link to our <a href='https://w3c.github.io/personalization-semantics/'>latest working draft of our explainer document</a>.",

  "report": "Presented an overview of the prototyping data-symbol attribute for personalization of web content.  Showed a demo using a Chrome Browser Extension that could switch depending on the users personal preferences between using BLISS or ARASAAC symbols which would show up as images above the text they represent.  Also shown was how the personal preference could show only the critical sections of the authored page and not render those portions of the page below a certain threshold also set by the user's \"data-distraction\" level of which there are three choices (low/med/critical)."
